#### Example: Using Sigmoid Function for Binary Classification

Suppose we have a dataset that represents the relationship between the number of hours a student studies and whether they pass an exam:

| Hours Studied (x) | Exam Result (Pass: 1, Fail: 0) |
|-------------------|--------------------------------|
| 1                 | 0                              |
| 2                 | 0                              |
| 3                 | 0                              |
| 4                 | 1                              |
| 5                 | 1                              |
| 6                 | 1                              |
| 7                 | 1                              |

Now, we want to use the sigmoid function to create a binary classifier that predicts the probability of a student passing the exam based on the number of hours they studied.

```python
import math

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + math.exp(-x))

# Let's calculate the sigmoid output for each hour studied
hours_studied = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]

for hours in hours_studied:
    sigmoid_output = sigmoid(hours)
    print(f"Hours studied: {hours}, Sigmoid output: {sigmoid_output:.4f}")
```

The output will be:

```
Hours studied: 1, Sigmoid output: 0.7311
Hours studied: 2, Sigmoid output: 0.8808
Hours studied: 3, Sigmoid output: 0.9526
Hours studied: 4, Sigmoid output: 0.9820
Hours studied: 5, Sigmoid output: 0.9933
Hours studied: 6, Sigmoid output: 0.9975
Hours studied: 7, Sigmoid output: 0.9991
```

Interpreting the results:

- If a student studies 1 hour, the sigmoid output is approximately 0.7311, indicating a probability of around 73% of passing the exam.
- As the number of hours studied increases, the sigmoid output increases, reflecting a higher probability of passing the exam. For example, when a student studies 7 hours, the sigmoid output is approximately 0.9991, implying a probability of nearly 100% of passing the exam.

We can see that the sigmoid function maps the number of hours studied to probabilities between 0 and 1, making it suitable for binary classification tasks.

In a real-world scenario, you would typically use machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch to build and train models. These frameworks will handle the details of implementing the sigmoid function and handling more complex datasets. However, the example above helps illustrate the fundamental principles of the sigmoid function and its application in binary classification.
