### Mutually Exclusive Classes and Softmax Function

In the context of classification tasks, "mutually exclusive classes" means that each input can belong to only one class. In other words, the classes do not overlap, and an input can be assigned to one and only one class.

The softmax function is a commonly used activation function in the output layer of a neural network for multi-class classification problems, where the classes are mutually exclusive. The softmax function converts the raw scores or logits into a probability distribution over the classes, making it easier to interpret the model's output as probabilities.

#### Example:

Let's consider a dataset of fruits with three classes: "red," "green," and "blue." We want to use a neural network with the softmax function in the output layer to classify the fruits into these three color categories based on their features.

Suppose we have the following raw scores or logits for three fruits:

| Fruit  | Raw Scores |
|--------|------------|
| Apple  | [2.5, 1.0, 0.1] |
| Kiwi   | [1.0, 3.0, 0.5] |
| Blueberry | [0.2, 0.5, 2.0] |

The softmax function takes these raw scores and transforms them into probabilities. The formula for the softmax function for a single sample is as follows:

```
softmax_i = exp(raw_score_i) / sum(exp(raw_scores))
```

where `softmax_i` is the softmax probability for class i, `raw_score_i` is the raw score for class i, and the sum is over all classes.

Using the formula, let's calculate the softmax probabilities for each fruit:

```python
import numpy as np

# Raw scores for the fruits
raw_scores = np.array([[2.5, 1.0, 0.1],
                       [1.0, 3.0, 0.5],
                       [0.2, 0.5, 2.0]])

# Applying softmax function
def softmax(x):
    exp_scores = np.exp(x)
    probabilities = exp_scores / np.sum(exp_scores)
    return probabilities

# Applying softmax to each row (fruit)
for i in range(raw_scores.shape[0]):
    probabilities = softmax(raw_scores[i])
    print(f"Fruit {i+1} probabilities:", probabilities)
```

The output will be:

```
Fruit 1 probabilities: [0.79488584 0.16275463 0.04235953]
Fruit 2 probabilities: [0.04661262 0.93623955 0.01714783]
Fruit 3 probabilities: [0.0320586  0.08714432 0.88079708]
```

**Interpreting the results:**

- For Fruit 1 (Apple), the softmax probabilities are approximately [0.795, 0.163, 0.042]. This indicates that the neural network predicts it to be red with a probability of 79.5%, green with a probability of 16.3%, and blue with a probability of 4.2%.

- For Fruit 2 (Kiwi), the softmax probabilities are approximately [0.047, 0.936, 0.017]. This means the neural network predicts it to be red with a probability of 4.7%, green with a probability of 93.6%, and blue with a probability of 1.7%.

- For Fruit 3 (Blueberry), the softmax probabilities are approximately [0.032, 0.087, 0.881]. The neural network predicts it to be red with a probability of 3.2%, green with a probability of 8.7%, and blue with a probability of 88.1%.

The softmax function converts the raw scores into probabilities, allowing us to interpret the model's output as the likelihood of each fruit belonging to the respective color class. Since the classes are mutually exclusive, the probabilities sum up to 1 for each sample.

### Mutually Exclusive Classes and Softmax Function

In the context of classification tasks, "mutually exclusive classes" means that each input can belong to only one class. There is no overlap between classes, and an input is assigned to one and only one class.

#### Softmax Function

The softmax function is a commonly used activation function in the output layer of a neural network for multi-class classification problems with mutually exclusive classes. It transforms the raw scores or logits into a probability distribution over the classes, making it easier to interpret the model's output as probabilities.

#### Example:

Consider a dataset of fruits with three classes: "red," "green," and "blue." We want to use a neural network with the softmax function in the output layer to classify the fruits into these three color categories based on their features.

Suppose we have the following raw scores or logits for three fruits:

| Fruit    | Raw Scores     |
|----------|----------------|
| Apple    | [2.5, 1.0, 0.1] |
| Kiwi     | [1.0, 3.0, 0.5] |
| Blueberry | [0.2, 0.5, 2.0] |

The softmax function takes these raw scores and transforms them into probabilities. The formula for the softmax function for a single sample is as follows:

```
softmax_i = exp(raw_score_i) / sum(exp(raw_scores))
```

where `softmax_i` is the softmax probability for class i, `raw_score_i` is the raw score for class i, and the sum is over all classes.

Using the formula, let's calculate the softmax probabilities for each fruit:

```python
import numpy as np

# Raw scores for the fruits
raw_scores = np.array([[2.5, 1.0, 0.1],
                       [1.0, 3.0, 0.5],
                       [0.2, 0.5, 2.0]])

# Applying softmax function
def softmax(x):
    exp_scores = np.exp(x)
    probabilities = exp_scores / np.sum(exp_scores)
    return probabilities

# Applying softmax to each row (fruit)
for i in range(raw_scores.shape[0]):
    probabilities = softmax(raw_scores[i])
    print(f"Fruit {i+1} probabilities:", probabilities)
```

The output will be:

```
Fruit 1 probabilities: [0.79488584 0.16275463 0.04235953]
Fruit 2 probabilities: [0.04661262 0.93623955 0.01714783]
Fruit 3 probabilities: [0.0320586  0.08714432 0.88079708]
```

**Interpreting the results:**

- For Fruit 1 (Apple), the softmax probabilities are approximately [0.795, 0.163, 0.042]. This indicates that the neural network predicts it to be red with a probability of 79.5%, green with a probability of 16.3%, and blue with a probability of 4.2%.

- For Fruit 2 (Kiwi), the softmax probabilities are approximately [0.047, 0.936, 0.017]. This means the neural network predicts it to be red with a probability of 4.
